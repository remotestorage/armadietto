## What is this?

Armadietto is a [RemoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io) server written for Node.js.

This is a complete rewrite of [reStore](https://github.com/jcoglan/restore).

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [a maintained version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) installed.
2. If you will be using Apache as a reverse proxy, ensure it is [version 2.4.49 or later](https://community.remotestorage.io/t/avoid-apache-as-a-basis-for-your-server/139).
3. Run `npm -g i armadietto`


## Usage

See the `notes` directory for configuring a reverse proxy and other recipes.

1. Run `armadietto -e` to see a sample configuration file.
2. Create a configuration file at `/etc/armadietto/conf` (or elsewhere). See below for values and their meanings.
3. Run `armadietto -c /etc/armadietto/conf`

To see all options, run `armadietto -h`. Set the environment `DEBUG` to log the headers of every request.

## Use as a library

The following Node script will run a basic server:

```js
process.umask(077);

const Armadietto = require('armadietto');
store   = new Armadietto.FileTree({path: 'path/to/storage'}),

server  = new Armadietto({
  store:  store,
  http:   {host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8000}
});

server.boot();
```

The `host` option is optional and specifies the hostname the server will listen
on. Its default value is `0.0.0.0`, meaning it will listen on all interfaces.

The server does not allow users to sign up, out of the box. If you need to allow
that, use the `allow.signup` option:

```js
var server = new Armadietto({
  store: store,
  http:  { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8000 },
  allow: { signup: true }
});
```

If you navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` you should then see a sign-up link
in the navigation.

## Storage security

In production, we recommend that you restrict access to the files managed by
your armadietto server as much as possible. This is particularly true if you host
your storage on a machine with other web applications; you need to protect your
files in the event that one of those apps is exploited.

You should take these steps to keep your storage safe:

* Pick a unique Unix user to run your server process; no other process on the
  box should run as this user:
  `sudo useradd armadietto --system --no-create-home`

* Do not run other applications as root, or as any user that could access files
  owned by your armadietto user
* Make sure the directory `path/to/storage` cannot be read, written or executed
  by anyone but this user:
  `sudo chmod 0700 /path/to/storage && sudo chown armadietto:armadietto /path/to/storage`

* Do not run armadietto as root; if you need to bind to port 80 or 443 use a
  reverse proxy like nginx, Apache2, caddy, lighttpd or enable bind capability:
  ```setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' `which armadietto` ```

* Ideally, run your storage inside a container or on a dedicated machine

If you're using the Redis backend, apply similar access restrictions to the
database and to any files containing the database access credentials.

## Serving over HTTPS

Since RemoteStorage is a system for storing arbitrary user-specific data, and
since it makes use of OAuth 2.0, we strongly recommend you serve it over a secure
connection. You can boot the server to listen for HTTP or HTTPS requests or
both.  
If armadietto is behind a reverse proxy on the same machine, the proxy can handle TLS, 
so armadietto only needs to set `enable` and `force` in the https configuration.
The reverse proxy must set the header `x-forwarded-proto` (or `x-forwarded-ssl` or `x-forwarded-scheme`) in the request passed to Armadietto. Armadietto does not yet support the `Forwarded` header.

This configuration boots the app on two ports, one secure and one
plaintext:

```js
const server = new Armadietto({
  store: store,
  http: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 8000
  },
  https: {
    force: true,
    host:  '127.0.0.1',
    port:  4343,
    key:   'path/to/ssl.key',
    cert:  'path/to/ssl.crt',
    ca:    'path/to/ca.pem'    // optional
  },
  logging: {
    stdout: ["debug"],
    log_files: ["error"],
    log_dir: "./some-log-dir"
  }

});

server.boot();
```

For example, if you use certificates from [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), you will set
```
    cert: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/domainname/cert.pem",
    key: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/domainname/privkey.pem"
```
where domainname is (usually) the DNS name of your server.

The `force: true` line in the `https` section means the app will:

* Return HTTPS URLs in WebFinger responses
* Force sign-up and OAuth login pages onto an HTTPS connection
* Refuse to process POST authentication requests over insecure connections
* Block insecure storage requests and revoke the client's access

Armadietto considers a request to be secure if:

* armadietto itself acts as an SSL terminator and the connection to it is encrypted
* The `X-Forwarded-SSL` header has the value `on`
* The `X-Forwarded-Proto` header has the value `https`
* The `X-Forwarded-Scheme` header has the value `https`

So you can have an SSL-terminating proxy in front of armadietto as long as it sets
one of those headers, and *does not* let external clients set them. In this
setup, you can set `https.force = true` but omit `https.port`; this means
armadietto itself will not accept encrypted connections but will apply the above
behaviour to enforce secure connections.

## Storage backends

armadietto supports pluggable storage backends, and comes with a file system
implementation out of the box (redis storage backend is on the way in
`feature/redis` branch):

* `Armadietto.FileTree` - Uses the filesystem hierarchy and stores each item in its
  own individual file. Content and metadata are stored in separate files so the
  content does not need base64-encoding and can be hand-edited. Must only be run
  using a single server process.

All the backends support the same set of features, including the ability to
store arbitrary binary data with content types and modification times.

They are configured as follows:

```js
// To use the file tree store:
const store = new Armadietto.FileTree({path: 'path/to/storage'});

// Then create the server with your store:
const server = new Armadietto({
  store:  store,
  http:   {port: process.argv[2]}
});

server.boot();
```

## Middleware

Armadietto is extensible through middleware.  Middleware is dependency injected in the same manner as switchable storage:  by defining  the `middleware` array in [./bin/armadietto.js](./bin/armadietto.js)' `init()`.

Middleware is configurable in the usual way via the server's configuration JSON, such as the default [./bin/dev-conf.json](./bin/dev-conf.json): see `extensions` key.

For examples of middleware configuration and use study [./spec/armadietto/middleware_spec.js](./spec/armadietto/middleware_spec.js).  The test file explains the expected interface for middleware classes and has a couple examples.

Available middleware extensions are touched upon below.

#### storage_allowance

The `storage_allowance` middleware limits each user's storage allowance as per the configuration.  The middleware embellishes the returned token to do its checks.  

> âš  This extension is currently limited to the filesystem storage back-end (file-tree).

User's storage capacity is checked only on authorization, not each request.  If a user is over-capacity, all writes will fail with HTTP 507/INSUFFICENT STORAGE until the user cleans up storage and re-authorizes.

The configuration:

``` 
  "extensions": {
    ...
    "storage_allowance": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_bytes": 10485760,
      "salt": "c0c0nut",
      "redis_url": "redis://localhost:6379"
    },
    ...
  }
```

- `enabled` flags whether this extension is enabled
- `max_bytes` is the maximum size of a user's storage
- `salt` is your own secret key to salt the claim in the token
- `redis_url` is the [redis](https://redis.com) url as per `[redis[s]:]//[[user][:password@]][host][:port][/db-number][?db=db-number[&password=bar[&option=value]]]`

#### rate_limiter

The `rate_limiter` middleware throttles requests from a single IP.

Throttling state is handled by [redis](https://redis.com) to enable clustered Armadietto deployments.

Throttling occurs solely against HTTP GET/PUT/DELETE *storage* requests.  The configuration parameters need to be tuned to work well in conjunction with client retries (currently at 10 seconds for [remoteStorage.js](https://remotestoragejs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) and non-abusive apps in mind.

The configuration below has well tuned defaults:

``` 
  "extensions": {
	...
    "rate_limiter": {
      "enabled": true,
      "requests_per_window": 20,
      "limiting_window_seconds": 10,
      "redis_url": "redis://localhost:6379"
    },
    ...
  }
```

- `enabled` flags whether this extension is enabled
- `requests_per_window` is the number of requests from a single IP are allowed per window
- `limiting_window_seconds` is the accounting time window period
- `redis_url` is the [redis](https://redis.com) url as per `[redis[s]:]//[[user][:password@]][host][:port][/db-number][?db=db-number[&password=bar[&option=value]]]`

## Debugging an installation

Set the environment `DEBUG` to enable logging.  For example `DEBUG=true armadietto -c /etc/armadietto/conf`
