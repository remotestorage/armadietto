# Modular Server

It's built using Express, so bespoke versions can be implemented by copying appFactory.js and adding new middleware.

There's an NPM module for almost anything worth doing in a Node.js server (albeit, not everything is production-quality).

## Configuration

Your configuration file *MUST* set `host_identity`.
It's normally the usual domain name of the host.
Changing `host_identity` will invalidate all grants of access, and make unavailable accounts stored in S3-compatible storage (unless you set `s3.user_name_suffix` to the old value).

### Modular Server Factory

The secret used to generate JWTs must have at least 64 cryptographically random ASCII characters.

The `account` object has methods to create users and check passwords.
The streaming storage handler is Express middleware and does the actual storage.
They may be the same object (as they are for S3-compatible storage).

S3-compatible storage is typically configured using environment variables; see the note for details.

If your server runs at a path other than root, you *MUST* pass the `basePath` argument to appFactory.

### app.set()

If you call `app.set('forceSSL', ...)` you must also call `app.set('httpsPort')` which is only used for this redirection.

### app.locals

You *MUST* set `app.locals.title` and `app.locals.signup` or the web pages won't render.


## Proxies

Production servers typically outsource TLS to a proxy server â€” nginx and Apache are both well-documented.  A proxy server can also cache static content. Armadietto sets caching headers to tell caches what they can and can't cache.

If the modular server is behind a proxy, you **MUST** set
`app.set('trust proxy', 1)`

## Development

### Logging

A successful request doesn't need extra info to be logged,
unless it's something notable like an account being created.
An unsuccessful request should log enough detail to recreate
why it failed.

Log info is much more helpful when it's clear what request
it's associated with. Code does not call the logger directly. Instead, messages are added to the set `res.logNotes`.
Multiple pieces of information don't need to be concatenated before adding to `logNotes`.  The logging middleware will
concatenate them when logging the request.
When an error has been thrown, the function `errToMessages`
is useful to extract fields from the error and its cause
(if any), eliminated duplicated messages.

A few activities not associated with requests do call the
logger directly.
