# Configuring a Reverse Proxy for Armadietto

1. [optional] Set a DNS A record for a new domain name, if Armadietto will appear as a different host than other websites served by your reverse proxy.
2. Ensure your TLS certificate includes the domain name Armadietto be will visible as.
3. [optional] Set up a name-based virtual server, if Armadietto will appear as a different host than other websites served by your reverse proxy.
4. Configure your reverse proxy, and have it set the header `x-forwarded-proto` (or `x-forwarded-ssl` or `x-forwarded-scheme`) in the request passed to Armadietto. Armadietto does not yet support the `Forwarded` header, nor the PROXY protocol. For Apache, the directives are `ProxyPass`, `ProxyPassReverse`, and `RequestHeader`. For Apache, a name-based virtual server and reverse proxy will resemble:
```
<VirtualHost *:443>
ServerName storage.example.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/remotestorage
SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile   /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem

ProxyPass        "/"  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30
ProxyPassReverse "/"  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
RequestHeader set x-forwarded-proto "https"
RequestHeader unset x-forwarded-ssl
RequestHeader unset x-forwarded-scheme
RequestHeader unset x-forwarded-host
</VirtualHost>
```
For nginx, a name-based virtual server and reverse proxy will resemble
```
server {
    server_name storage.example.com
    listen 0.0.0.0:443 ssl;

    include /etc/nginx/include/ssl;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/armadietto.access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/armadietto.error.log;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        # if listening on an non-standard port, use
        # proxy_set_header Host $host:$server_port;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-SSL "";
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Scheme "";
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host "";

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_buffering off;
    }
}

```
5. Run `armadietto -e` to see a sample configuration file.
6. Create a configuration file at `/etc/armadietto/conf.json` (or elsewhere). See README.md for values and their meanings.
7. Run `armadietto -c /etc/armadietto/conf.json`
